{"name":"Gubbins","tagline":"Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences","body":"# Overview\r\nSince the introduction of high-throughput, second-generation DNA sequencing technologies, there has been an enormous increase in the size of datasets being used for estimating bacterial population phylodynamics. Although many phylogenetic techniques are scalable to hundreds of bacterial genomes, methods which have been used for mitigating the effect of mechanisms of horizontal sequence transfer on phylogenetic reconstructions cannot cope with these new datasets. Gubbins (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences) is an algorithm that iteratively identifies loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions while concurrently constructing a phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside of these regions. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistic models of short-term bacterial evolution, and can be run in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Virtual machine\r\nWe have created virtual machine which has all of the software setup, along with the test datasets from the paper, based on [Bio-Linux 8](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/). If you run Windows, then this is the only way to use Gubbins on your machine. You need to first install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then load the virtual machine, using the 'Import Appliance' option. The root password is 'manager'.\r\n\r\n* [Virtual Machine with Gubbins installed](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/pathogens/gubbins/gubbins_0.6.ova)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
