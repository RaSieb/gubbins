v2.3.2 - 12 Jan 2018
-----
Update installation instructions to remove all reference to HomeBrew.

v2.3.1 - 22 Sept 2017
-----
Output a tree with the internal nodes labelled.

v2.3.0 - 21 Sept 2017
-----
Add helptext to gubbins drawer and require tree as a positional argument rather than an option.

v2.2.3 - 15 Sept 2017
-----
Fix default extended help text.

v2.2.2 - 4 Sept 2017
-----
Allow the use of RAXML AVX2 binaries. 

v2.2.1 - 20 Feb 2017
-----
Remove use of Biopythons sub_features function which has been deprecated.

v2.2.0 - 31 Oct 2016
------
By default dont filter out sequences which are 100% identical.

v2.1.0 - 22 July 2016
------
Use GTRCAT model by default in RAxML instead of GTRGAMMA (massive speedup).
C code optimisations in Gubbins.

v2.0.0 - 26 May 2016
------
Reconstruct internal sequences by default using RAxML rather than fastML. 
Addresses speed issues raised by users. 
RAxML version 8 now required as a minimum.
Remove pairwise support since RAxML wont support it. Need at least 4 genomes as input.

v1.4.10 - 31 Oct 2016
------
Backport a change so that by default dont filter out sequences which are 100% identical.

v1.4.9 - 15 Apr 2016
------
If sequences are 100% identical, filter out duplicates.
Refactor Python FASTA validation to separate file.

v1.4.8 - 12 Apr 2016
------
Fix to lookup of CPU instruction sets to decide which versions of RAxML are supported. Provided by aaronk.

v1.4.7 - 29 Feb 2016
------
Fix allocation from stack bug (from jeromekelleher). For large numbers of SNPs allocating from the stack caused a segfault. 
This fixes the issue by allocating from the heap with malloc.

v1.4.6 - 29 Feb 2016
------
Added back midpoint rerooting as the default. Was the default up to v1.3.5 (25/6/15) and was removed by mistake. 
It didnt effect the recombination detection, just the tree didnt look as pretty at the end.

v1.4.5 - 13 Jan 2016
------
Removed the install.sh file which gets regenerated automatically when the code is built, 
but if its there already it can cause problems on some platforms.

v1.4.4 - 9 Dec 2015
------
Debian reported that Gubbins failed to build on one platform. These changes fix this bug and 
cleaned up some other build issues to make it easier to compile on OSX from source.

v1.4.3 - 19 Nov 2015
------
The Debian directory was removed because it now lives in its own repository in the Debian world.

v1.4.2 - 2 Sept 2015
------
If filenames are too long, RAxML crashes. To avoid this a hard limit was introduced, and Gubbins exits with an error message.

v1.4.1 - 7 Jul 2015
------
Update Brew installation instructions and python dependancy versions.

v1.4.0 - 1 Jul 2015
------
Update from python 2 to python 3. This is to allow for inclusion in Debian (because they dont accept python 2 anymore). 
Also detect fastml version and modify parameters as required.
